# DanDanDange
A Console output based game developed in C++ without any library.

## How to compile 
Just compile the code from Main.cpp in your desired CPP compiler , I've used codeblocks.

## How to Play
After compiling use W, S, A, D for movement(W:UP,S:DOWN,A:LEFT,D:RIGHT) of Your Character which is a BLOCK shaped, and try to reach the food '0' before enemy '*' there is a wining condition if you score 100 points before enemy completes 150 points you won otherwise enemy would be a winner, Enemy can move diagonally in a single move but you cannot furthermore if you and enemy met at the same coordinate then you got a deduction from your health of 3.  

## NOTE 
This is my very first projects from the early days of my learning coding. developed in 2015
